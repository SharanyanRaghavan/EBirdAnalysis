# EBirdAnalysis
READ ME:


Welcome to the EBird Analysis Tool. The purpose of this tool is to help analyze datasets downloaded from EBird, a bioinformatic resource focused on user inputed sightings of birds.

This program gives you information about the bird's name, locations where it is most commonly found, when it can be found in certain areas, sightings by year and whether breeding populations have been observed. 

There are two versions of the program. Ebird_Global handles global data, and allows you to use huge datasets. Be warned, using such big datasets can slow your computer down. EBird_Analysis2 is used for countrywide data, and allows you to narrow your search down further. It also gives you csv files for your data, as well as the database file itself

This program can be used to track migration patterns, population and breeding in bird species, especially endangered ones. One drawback is it relies on community data, but this is an excellent way to get the general public involved in conservation. 

How to use:

To begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Download data from Ebird. The site allows you to select specific data; you can select a single species, or look at all species in a specific place, or if you want, look at all species across the globe. Once downloaded, copy the path to the txt file that contains the sightings and run it through the code. It may take a while depending on the size, so be patient. 

Once it's loaded, if you are using EBird_Analysis2, it will ask if it is Country, State or County data. If using the global version, it will ask if you want to narrow it down. Once you enter your wanted inputs, you can enter a bird's common or scientific name, taken from a list also generated. Be warned; bird names are changing constantly. In the U.S, over 70 species will change their common name due to them being named after people. Therefore, to make it easier, we use the names from the data provided. You can also ask for breeding data. Depending on the scope of your project, it will give between 10-100 locations, yearly population counts and breeding data. 

Have fun, and happy birding :)
